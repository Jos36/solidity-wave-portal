# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

an example dApp built with solidiy, connected with a react frontend where you can wave at me with a 50% chance to earn rinkeby (testnet) ether

Try running some of the following tasks for the testnet deployment:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/run.js
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```

Or try the localhost deployment:

```
npx hardhat node 
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
